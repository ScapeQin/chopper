# The monitor is used to monitor the FS fragmentation status.
# What I want to see is, generally, how's the metadata. This may include:
#
#  SIZE of inode and extent tree. (number of inode block and extent tree
#  block). This can be find by debugfs "dump_extents [-n] [-l] filespec".
#  But you have to do it for ALL files in the file system, which might be
#  slow. I haven't got a better approach. A good indicator of metadata
#  problem is #_metadata_block/#_data_block. This should be very informative
#  about the aging of a file system which causes metadata disaster.
#       I expect the following from the output of this per file:
#       
#       filepath create_time meta_ratio n_metablock n_datablock
#
#  Extent fragmentation overview. This can be obtained by e2freefrag. This
#  should give me a good sense of how fragemented the FS is. The acceleration
#  rate of fragmentation might be a good indicator of whether a workload
#  can cause metadata problem. (Because of fragmentation, physical blocks
#  might not be able to allocated contiguously, then it needs two or more
#  extents to the logically contiguous blocks.)
#       I expect the following from the output of this per FS:
#       JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL OUTPUT BUT FORMAT IT A LITTLE BIT
